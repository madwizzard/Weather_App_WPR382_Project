# Weather_App_WPR382_Project
 This is my first project where I used React.
 I learned a lot about React, express and API's and how to use them. 



# React Weather App

React is a JavaScript library for building user interfaces. 
I tried to make the app as modular and simple as possible.

## Running the app
Open a terminal within the src folder and run the following commands:

```bash
node server.js
```
Open a second terminal in the weather-app folder and run the following commands:
```bash
npm start
```
## Usage

To use the app, simply type in the zip code of the city **in South Africa** you want to get the weather for and press enter.
You can click on the °C or °F to change the temperature from Celsius to Fahrenheit and vice versa.
